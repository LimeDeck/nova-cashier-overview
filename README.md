This [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) tool lets you:
- view a database subscription (subscription name is a parameter)
- view Stripe subscription details
- view invoices for a given subscription with a downloadable link
- change a subscription plan
- cancel a subscription
- resume a subscription
- avoid unnecessary Stripe API call when you load a resource to quickly get a status information and dive deeper if you need it

### Default view of the subscription

## Disclaimer

This package has been heavily inspired by [themsaid/nova-cashier-manager](https://github.com/themsaid/nova-cashier-manager) and was created to be in sync with latest changes in Cashier as well as to optimize default loads by avoiding a Stripe API request unless it's needed. Structure of this repository was inspired by [spatie/skeleton-nova-tool](https://github.com/spatie/skeleton-nova-tool).

## Installation

You can install the nova tool in to a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require limedeck/nova-cashier-overview
```

Next up, you use the resource tool with Nova. This is typically done in the `fields` method of the desired Nova Resource.

```php
use LimeDeck\NovaCashierOverview\Subscription;

// ...

public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        ID::make()->sortable(),

        ...

        Subscription::make(),

        // if you want to display a specific subscription or multiple
        Subscription::make('a-fancy-subscription-name'), 

        ...
    ];
}
```

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
